OPTIONS

    --expand-shortlinks, -x
        Expand t.co shortened URLs into unshortened URLs
        (Default: does not expand shortened URLs)

    --device, -d
        Set device descriptor. For most applications, it's not necessary to set
        this option. (Default: --device="iPhone 11 Pro Max") For a full list of
        device descriptions, see https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/src/common/DeviceDescriptors.ts

CAVEATS

    1. Expanding shortened URLs is slow because it takes 1+ network request to
       lookup a shortened URLs destination. Expand short URLs with care. (`-x`)

    2. The number of tweets returned is not known ahead of time. Because tweets
       are screen scraped as a headless browser scrolls through the page, the
       number of tweets is dependent on the number of scrolls, the number of
       tweets, and the length of each tweet. **However, for most accounts, you
       can expect to get back between 20-50 of the most recent tweets.**

    3. This program (and its underlying node.js library) uses
       [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for scraping, it is 
       fairly resource intensive. Unfortunately, there's no way around this with
       puppeteer.
